'''
Write code that receives 2 folders, 
checks the csv files in them, 
and for each files with the same name and extention in both folders - 
checks if they have the same structure (number of columns and headers name). 
The code will return a list of matching csv files, and a list of unmatching csv files

1. verify the folders are under current directory, with correct path
2. Get the content of each directory into separate list
3. find equal list values
    for each equal list value:
        is it empty
        compare file names are equal str
        fetch the first row 
        compare the first row for the file with the same file name from other folder
if all requerments are met then append the file name to the list of matching
else append the file name to the list of unmatching
return two lists
print
